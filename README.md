# TurboDroid simulation

CAUTION! This work is in progress. It is still buggy, but you can use it if you want to understand the strategy of TurboDroid robot, winner of Toulouse Robot Race 2018 in the "driving without obstacles" category.

## What is it?

Simulation of TurboDroid robot on the Toulouse Robot Race Track.

## Installation

You will need to install the V-Rep robot simulator:
http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/downloads.html

You will also need python3 and some python libraries. We recommend that you install python with Anaconda.

You will also need the BlueZero library and its dependancies. On Windows, you can get all the needed dlls in V-Rep installation directory. Create a working directory, and copy/paste the following dlls in this working directory:

* b0.dll
* boost_date_time-vc141-mt-x64-1_68.dll
* boost_filesystem-vc141-mt-x64-1_68.dll
* boost_program_options-vc141-mt-x64-1_68.dll
* boost_regex-vc141-mt-x64-1_68.dll
* boost_serialization-vc141-mt-x64-1_68.dll
* boost_system-vc141-mt-x64-1_68.dll
* boost_thread-vc141-mt-x64-1_68.dll
* libzmq-mt-4_3_1.dll
* zlib1.dll

## Usage

This is the procedure for Windows (see above for the b0 dependancies). On Linux and MacOS, the procedure for getting the BlueZero dependancies differs.

First, open the turbodroid.ttt file in the V-REP simulator.

Then, launch:
```console
cd MY_WORKING_DIRECTORY_CONTAINING_THE_BLUEZERO_DLLs
python PATH_TO_THE_PROJECT\launch_robot_simu.py
```

That's all, you should see the robot moving in the simulator!

You can then edit the python files to create your own code to command TurboDroid.
